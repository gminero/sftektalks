For 2 years, I was a Product Specialist for the Coveo for Salesforce line of business. This included troubleshooting visualforce pages, lightning communities, lightning components, apex code as well as Coveo related components. I then transitioned to becoming Coveo for Salesforce's Technical Evangelist where I focused on assisting to develop and support the growing community in the Salesforce environment. 

Today, I dedicate most of my time to helping our partners in our growing community.

I am an active member on [Salesforce Stackexchange](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/31663/glls) and enjoy spending time helping others as well as learning from the different posts on the site.

On my free time, I enjoy coding in python, web development and learning new frameworks that can help me on my day to day life.
