For 2 years, I was a Product Specialist for the Coveo for Salesforce line of business. This included troubleshooting visualforce pages, lightning communities, lightning components, apex code as well as Coveo related components. I then transitioned to becoming Coveo for Salesforce's Technical Evangelist and I currently focus on assisting to develop and support the growing community in the Salesforce environment. I am active on the salesforce.stackexchange.com forum as well as answers.coveo.com .

On my free time, I enjoy coding in python, web development and learning new frameworks that can help me on my day to day life.
